            <h2 class="notes-title">— UPDATE NOTES —</h2>
            <h4>version 5.2</h4>
            <ul>
              <li class="update">There is now a verification system! This means that you now have to verify that you own the game before playing. This may not be something you guys want, however it is a requirement for this project to not get taken down (again). That being said, no matter how you retrieve the game files to play the port, a data.win (or equivalent) file of some sort is required to play the game.</li>
              <li class="update">A bug has been fixed that shrunk the screen/game canvas upon entering fullscreen!</li>
              <li class="update">As of this update, there are no other planned additions. Saving functionality may now be working for some of you, but if you have been having problems with SAVEs for the past few updates, don't count on it. v6 is coming SOON!!!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="notes-title">— UPDATE NOTES —</h2>
            <h4>version 5.1</h4>
            <ul>
              <li class="update">A BOSS RUSH mode has been added! You can now fight all of your favorite bosses to test your skill! (Note that this mode will not be saved by Offline Mode as it requires a subdomain to be used to avoid conflict with any in-game SAVE files.)</li>
              <li class="update">Fixed a teensy tiny bug that caused the OST player to not work in Offline Mode!</li>
              <li class="update">The WHOLE gameplay experience has been completely revamped! The entire game now runs in a single page (improving direct game linking), and the official Chapter Select screen has been brought back, making the gameplay experience feel even better than before!</li>
              <li class="update">[Hopefully and possibly don't quote me on it] Fixed a bug (that has caused me endless suffering since the port came out) that has caused in-game saving to sometimes not function properly and that has also caused the game to sometimes not be able to read imported SAVEs!</li>
              <li class="update">The SAVE Manager (located in the WinMenu, accessible by typing in the word 'pie' on keyboard or tapping 5 times on mobile) has been updated to support importing many files at a time and exporting all of your SAVEs at once into a zip file! (idea courtesy of gameboi4784)</li>
              <li class="update">There is now a DELTARUNE OST player! It has (and will be updated to have future) songs from all the DELTARUNE Chapters! (idea courtesy of dream4435)</li>

            <h2 class="notes-title">— UPDATE NOTES —</h2>
            <h4>version 4.0.2</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The dog, the myth, the legend is finally here! Click/tap on him for something fun!</li>
              <li class="update">There is now a new WinMenu feature (mostly for mobile players, it works on PC too!) that allows you to enter fullscreen if the in-game button doesn't work!</li>
              <li class="update">Fixed a weird bug that made the script that played the “VHS” video in Chapter 3 prevent the mobile controls from working, keeping mobile players from playing the specific chapter.</li>
              <li class="update">The official/base DELTARUNE version has been updated to PC v1.03, including many bug fixes by Toby Fox! You can view his full list of changes <a href="103.jpg">here</a>!</li>
              <li class="update">The WinMenu is now accessible to mobile players! (Typing in the word "<strong>pie</strong>" in-game on PC or tapping 5 times on mobile will open up the <strong>WinMenu</strong>, a menu that provides quality-of-life features to DELTARUNEWeb!)</li>
              <li class="update">An <strong>Offline Mode</strong> has now been added to the site, downloading the game to your cache and allowing you to visit the site when you are offline! However, please keep in mind that the whole site is about 2.4GB in total, so be cautious of your free space. Offline Mode will also not allow you to receive updates and to receive them you will have to disable it and re-enable it. Enjoy!</li>
              <li class="update">A (temporary?? It will be updated in the future in my opinion it just looks kinda bad) loading screen has been added to let you know how much of the game has loaded/is downloading.</li>
              <li class="update">A bug has been fixed that did not allow mobile players to correctly enter fullscreen in-game!</li>
              <li class="update">The chapters are now FULLY consistent, and progressing to the next chapter after completing one finally works as intended, fixing the previous bug where selecting “Continue to Chapter [next]” would crash the game!</li>
              <li class="update">Fixed a bug where the “VHS” video that plays during your first encounter with Tenna in Chapter 3 would not play on certain browsers (e.g., Opera GX). The video should now play correctly across all supported browsers!</li>
